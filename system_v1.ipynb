This allows the GPU to access data stored in system memory as if it were located in its own local memory, improving performance and reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred between the CPU and GPU over the bus.\\n\\nOn the other hand, an I/O MMU is a hardware component that manages the memory mapping for I/O devices. It translates virtual addresses used by the CPU into physical addresses in the I/O device's memory space, allowing the CPU to access I/O devices as if they were regular memory. This can help improve system performance and security by hiding the complexities of I/O addressing from the CPU and providing a more consistent memory model for software.\\n\\nSo while both GARTs and I/O MMUs deal with memory mapping and addressing, they serve different purposes in the system. A GART is specifically used to map virtual addresses used by the CPU for graphics operations into physical addresses in video memory, while an I/O MMU maps virtual addresses used by the CPU for I/O operations into physical addresses in the I/O device's memory space.\",\n",

However, the alternative future sequences were drawn by Terry Austin, and other artists contributed to the later adaptations of this story into other media formats like animation and film.

This allows the GPU to access data stored in system memory as if it were located in its own local memory, improving performance and reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred between the CPU and GPU over the bus.\\n\\nOn the other hand, an I/O MMU is a hardware component that manages the memory mapping for I/O devices. It translates virtual addresses used by the CPU into physical addresses in the I/O device's memory space, allowing the CPU to access I/O devices as if they were regular memory. This can help improve system performance and security by hiding the complexities of I/O addressing from the CPU and providing a more consistent memory model for software.\\n\\nSo while both GARTs and I/O MMUs deal with memory mapping and addressing, they serve different purposes in the system. A GART is specifically used to map virtual addresses used by the CPU for graphics operations into physical addresses in video memory, while an I/O MMU maps virtual addresses used by the CPU for I/O operations into physical addresses in the I/O device's memory space.\",\n",

It includes various palaces, cathedrals, and administrative buildings. The Kremlin is surrounded by thick walls and towers, making it a formidable fortress.\\n\\nDetinets, on the other hand, was the original fortified core of the Moscow Kremlin. It was built in the late 13th century and served as the residence of the Grand Prince of Moscow and his court. Detinets means \\\"citadel\\\" or \\\"fortress\\\" in Russian. It is a smaller, more compact area within the larger Kremlin complex, which includes the Cathedral Square with its famous cathedrals such as St. Basil's Cathedral and the Archangel Michael Cathedral.\\n\\nSo while both structures are fortified complexes and have served residential and administrative functions, the Moscow Kremlin is a larger complex that includes Detinets as one of its parts.\",\n",

Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affect muscle coordination and movement, often caused by damage to the developing brain before or during birth. The term \\\"cerebral palsy\\\" was first used in 1845 by Dr. John Hinton, but it was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that the condition began to be better understood and diagnosed. Early treatments for cerebral palsy focused on managing symptoms through physical therapy, orthopedic interventions, and the use of braces or other assistive devices.\",\n",

The original X-Men comic book storyline, which was published in issues #141-142 of Uncanny X-Men in 1981, was written by Chris Claremont and illustrated by John Byrne. However, the alternative future sequences were drawn by Terry Austin, and other artists contributed to the later adaptations of this story into other media formats like animation and film. So while Claremont's role is significant, it's important to acknowledge the contributions of other creators involved in bringing \\\"Days of Future Past\\\" to life.\",\n",

            "{What is the capital of France?: {'France': [\"France, officially the French Republic, is a country located primarily in Western Europe. Its overseas regions and territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean, giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world. Metropolitan France shares borders with Belgium and Luxembourg to the north, Germany to the northeast, Switzerland to the east, Italy and Monaco to the southeast, Andorra and Spain to the south, and a maritime border with the United Kingdom to the northwest. Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea. Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and have a total population of 68.4 million as of January 2024. France is a semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre.\\nMetropolitan France was settled during the Iron Age by Celtic tribes known as Gauls before Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture. In the Early Middle Ages, the Franks formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia evolving into the Kingdom of France. In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but decentralized feudal kingdom, but from the mid-14th to the mid-15th centuries, France was plunged into a dynastic conflict with England known as the Hundred Years' War. In the 16th century, the French Renaissance saw culture flourish and a French colonial empire rise. Internally, France was dominated by the conflict with the House of Habsburg and the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Huguenots. France was successful in the Thirty Years' War and further increased its influence during the reign of Louis XIV.\\nThe French Revolution of 1789 overthrew the Ancien Régime and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating part of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured the Bourbon Restoration until the founding of the French Second Republic which was succeeded by the Second French Empire upon Napoleon III's takeover. His empire collapsed during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. This led to the establishment of the Third French Republic, and subsequent decades saw a period of economic prosperity and cultural and scientific flourishing known as the Belle Époque. France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious at great human and economic cost. It was among the Allies of World War II, but it surrendered and was occupied in 1940. Following its liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the defeat in the Algerian War. The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle. Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France.\\nFrance retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science, and philosophy. It hosts the fourth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the world's leading tourist destination, receiving 100 million foreign visitors in 2023. A developed country, France has a high nominal per capita income globally, and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world. It is a great power, being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state. France is a founding \"], 'Overseas France': ['Overseas France (French: France d\\'outre-mer, also France ultramarine) consists of 13 French territories outside Europe, mostly the remnants of the French colonial empire that remained a part of the French state under various statuses after decolonisation. Most, but not all are part of the European Union.\\n\"Overseas France\" is a collective name; while used in everyday life in France, it is not an administrative designation in its own right. Instead, the five overseas regions have exactly the same administrative status as the thirteen metropolitan regions; the five overseas collectivities are semi-autonomous; and New Caledonia is an autonomous territory. Overseas France includes island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, French Guiana on the South American continent, and several peri-Antarctic islands as well as a claim in Antarctica. Excluding the district of Adélie Land, where French sovereignty is effective de jure by French law, but where the French exclusive claim on this part of Antarctica is frozen by the Antarctic Treaty (signed in 1959), overseas France covers a land area of 120,396 km2 (46,485 sq mi) and accounts for 18.0% of the French Republic\\'s land territory. Its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of 9,825,538 km2 (3,793,661 sq mi) accounts for 96.7% of the EEZ of the French Republic.\\nOutside Europe, four broad classes of overseas French territorial administration currently exist: overseas departments/regions, overseas collectivities, the sui generis territory of New Caledonia, and uninhabited territories. From a legal and administrative standpoint, these four classes have varying legal status and levels of autonomy, although all permanently inhabited territories have representation in both France\\'s National Assembly and Senate, which together make up the French Parliament.\\n2,834,000 people lived in overseas France in January 2024. Most of these residents are citizens of France and citizens of the European Union. This makes them able to vote in French and European elections.\\n\\n\\n== Varying constitutional statuses ==\\n\\n\\n=== Overseas regions and departments ===\\n\\nOverseas regions have exactly the same status as France\\'s mainland regions. The French Constitution provides that, in general, French laws and regulations (France\\'s civil code, penal code, administrative law, social laws, tax laws, etc.) apply to French overseas regions just as in metropolitan France, but can be adapted as needed to suit the region\\'s particular needs. Hence, the local administrations of French overseas regions cannot themselves pass new laws.\\n\\nFrench Guiana (since 1946)\\nGuadeloupe (since 1946)\\nMartinique (since 1946)\\nMayotte (since 2011)\\n1976–2003: sui generis overseas territory\\n2001–2003: with the designation departmental community\\n2003–2011: overseas community.\\nIn the 2009 Mahoran status referendum, Mahorans voted to become an overseas department in 2011, which occurred on 31 March 2011.\\nRéunion (since 1946)\\n\\n\\n=== Overseas collectivities ===\\n\\nThe category of \"overseas collectivity\" (French: collectivité d\\'outre-mer or COM) was created by France\\'s constitutional reform of 28 March 2003. Each overseas collectivity has its own statutory laws.\\nIn contrast to overseas departments/regions, the overseas collectivities are empowered to make their own laws, except in certain areas reserved to the French national government (such as defense, international relations, trade and currency, and judicial and administrative law). The overseas collectivities are governed by local elected assemblies and by the French Parliament and French Government, with a cabinet member, the Minister of the Overseas, in charge of issues related to the overseas territories.\\n\\nFrench Polynesia (1946–2003: overseas territory; since 2003: overseas collectivity): In 2004 it was given the designation of \"overseas country\" (French: pays d\\'outre-mer), but the Constitutional Council of France has ruled that this designation did not create a new political category.\\nSaint Ba'], 'New France': [\"New France (French: Nouvelle-France) was the territory colonized by France in North America, beginning with the exploration of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence by Jacques Cartier in 1534 and ending with the cession of New France to Great Britain and Spain in 1763 under the Treaty of Paris.\\nA vast viceroyalty, New France consisted of five colonies at its peak in 1712, each with its own administration: Canada, the most developed colony, which was divided into the districts of Quebec (around what is now called Quebec City), Trois-Rivières, and Montreal; Hudson Bay; Acadia in the northeast; Terre-Neuve on the island of Newfoundland; and Louisiana. It extended from Newfoundland to the Canadian Prairies and from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico, including all the Great Lakes of North America.  The continent-traversing Saint Lawrence and Mississippi rivers were means of carrying French influence through much of North America.\\nIn the 16th century, the lands were used primarily to extract natural resources, such as furs, through trade with the various indigenous peoples. In the seventeenth century, successful settlements began in Acadia and in Quebec. In the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, France ceded to Great Britain its claims over mainland Acadia, Hudson Bay, and Newfoundland. France established the colony of Île Royale on Cape Breton Island, where they built the Fortress of Louisbourg.\\nThe population rose slowly but steadily. In 1754, New France's population consisted of 10,000 Acadians, 55,000 Canadiens, and about 4,000 settlers in upper and lower Louisiana; 69,000 in total. The British expelled the Acadians in the Great Upheaval from 1755 to 1764, and their descendants are dispersed in the Maritime provinces of Canada and in Maine and Louisiana, with small populations in Chéticamp, Nova Scotia, and the Magdalen Islands. Some also went to France.\\nAfter the Seven Years' War (which included the French and Indian War in America), France ceded the rest of New France to Great Britain and Spain in the Treaty of Paris of 1763 (except the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon). Britain acquired Canada, Acadia, and French Louisiana east of the Mississippi River, except for the Île d'Orléans, which was granted to Spain with the territory to the west. In 1800, Spain returned its portion of Louisiana to France under the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso, and Napoleon Bonaparte sold it to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, permanently ending French colonial efforts on the American mainland.\\nNew France eventually became absorbed within the United States and Canada, with the only vestige of French rule being the tiny islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, an overseas collectivity of France, although Quebec remains predominately French-speaking. In the United States, the legacy of New France includes numerous place names as well as small pockets of French-speaking communities.\\n\\n\\n== Settlements of New France ==\\n\\nNew France had five colonies or territories, each with its own administration: Canada (the Great Lakes region, the Ohio Valley, and the St. Lawrence River Valley), Acadia (the Gaspé Peninsula, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, St. John's Island, and Île Royale-Cape Breton), Hudson Bay (and James Bay), Terre-Neuve (south Newfoundland), and Louisiana;.\\nAcadia  (1604–1713) — (areas, Port Royal, Île Saint-Jean, Île-Royale, New Brunswick and Maine)\\nCanada (1608–1763) —(districts, Québec, Trois-Rivières and Montreal; areas, Pays d'en Haut and Domaine du roy)\\nHudson Bay —(Hudson Bay conflicts 17th and 18th centuries)\\nTerre-Neuve (1662–1713)\\nLouisiana (1682–1763, 1801–1803) —(district, Illinois Country; area, Ohio Country)\\nThe 1715 Treaty of Utrecht resulted in the relinquishing of French claims to mainland Acadia, the Hudson Bay and Newfoundland, and the establishment of the colony of Île Royale, now called Cape Breton Island, where the French built the Fortress of Louisbourg.\\n\\n\\n=== Growth of the settlements ===\\n\\nThe European population grew slowly und\"]}, Who wrote the play 'Hamlet'?: {'Hamlet': ['The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, often shortened to Hamlet (), is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare sometime between 1599 and 1601. It is Shakespeare\\'s longest play. Set in Denmark, the play depicts Prince Hamlet and his attempts to exact revenge against his uncle, Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet\\'s father in order to seize his throne and marry Hamlet\\'s mother. Hamlet is considered among the \"most powerful and influential tragedies in the English language\", with a story capable of \"seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others\". It is widely considered one of the greatest plays of all time. Three different early versions of the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1, 1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and passages missing from the others.\\nMany works have been pointed to as possible sources for Shakespeare\\'s play, from ancient Greek tragedies to Elizabethan dramas. The editors of the Arden Shakespeare question the idea of \"source hunting\", pointing out that it presupposes that authors always require ideas from other works for their own, and suggests that no author can have an original idea or be an originator. When Shakespeare wrote, there were many stories about sons avenging the murder of their fathers, and many about clever avenging sons pretending to be foolish in order to outsmart their foes. This would include the story of the ancient Roman, Lucius Junius Brutus, which Shakespeare apparently knew, as well as the story of Amleth, which was preserved in Latin by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum, and printed in Paris in 1514. The Amleth story was subsequently adapted and then published in French in 1570 by the 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest. It has a number of plot elements and major characters in common with Shakespeare\\'s Hamlet, and lacks others that are found in Shakespeare. Belleforest\\'s story was first published in English in 1608, after Hamlet had been written, though it is possible that Shakespeare had encountered it in the French-language version.\\n\\n\\n== Characters ==\\n\\n\\n== Plot ==\\n\\n\\n=== Act I ===\\nPrince Hamlet of Denmark is the son of the recently deceased King Hamlet, and nephew of King Claudius, his father\\'s brother and successor. Claudius hastily married King Hamlet\\'s widow, Gertrude, Hamlet\\'s mother, and took the throne for himself. Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighbouring Norway, in which King Hamlet slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle some years ago. Although Denmark defeated Norway and the Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras\\'s infirm brother, Denmark fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king\\'s son, Prince Fortinbras, is imminent.\\nOn a cold night on the ramparts of Elsinore, the Danish royal castle, the sentries Bernardo and Marcellus discuss a ghost resembling the late King Hamlet which they have recently seen, and bring Prince Hamlet\\'s friend Horatio as a witness. After the ghost appears again, the three vow to tell Prince Hamlet what they have witnessed.\\nThe court gathers the next day, and King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss affairs of state with their elderly adviser Polonius. Claudius grants permission for Polonius\\'s son Laertes to return to school in France, and he sends envoys to inform the King of Norway about Fortinbras. Claudius also questions Hamlet regarding his continuing to grieve for his father, and forbids him to return to his university in Wittenberg. After the court exits, Hamlet despairs of his father\\'s death and his mother\\'s hasty remarriage. Learning of the ghost from Horatio, Hamlet resolves to see it himself.\\n\\nAs Polonius\\'s son Laertes prepares to depart for France, Polonius offers him advice that culminates in the maxim \"to thine own self be true.\" Polonius\\'s daughter, Ophelia, admits her interest in Hamlet, but Laertes warns her against seeking the prince\\'s attention, and Polonius orders her to reject his advances. That nigh'], 'Hamlet (place)': ['A hamlet is a human settlement that is smaller than a town or village. This is often simply an informal description of a smaller settlement or possibly a subdivision or satellite entity to a larger settlement. Sometimes  a hamlet is defined for official or administrative purposes.\\nThe word and concept of a hamlet can be traced back to Norman England, where the Old French hamelet came to apply to small human settlements.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nThe word comes from Anglo-Norman hamelet, corresponding to Old French hamelet, the diminutive of Old French hamel meaning a little village.  This, in turn, is a diminutive of Old French ham, possibly borrowed from (West Germanic) Franconian languages. It is related to the modern French hameau, Dutch heem, Frisian hiem, German Heim, Old English hām, and Modern English home.\\n\\n\\n== By country ==\\n\\n\\n=== Afghanistan ===\\nIn Afghanistan, the counterpart of the hamlet is the qala (Dari: قلعه, Pashto: کلي) meaning \"fort\" or \"hamlet\". The Afghan qala is a fortified group of houses, generally with its own community building such as a mosque, but without its own marketplace. The qala is the smallest type of settlement in Afghan society, outsized by the village (Dari/Pashto: ده), which is larger and includes a commercial area.\\n\\n\\n=== Canada ===\\nIn Canada\\'s three territories, hamlets are officially designated municipalities. As of January 1, 2010:\\n\\nNorthwest Territories had 11 hamlets, each of which had a population of less than 900 people as of the 2016 census;\\nNunavut had 24 hamlets, with populations ranging from 129 to 2,842 as of the 2016 census; and\\nYukon had two hamlets, both of which had a population of less than 450 people as of the 2016 census.\\nIn Canada\\'s provinces, hamlets are usually small unincorporated communities within a larger municipality (similar to civil townships in the United States), such as many communities within the single-tier municipalities of Ontario, Alberta\\'s specialized and rural municipalities, and Saskatchewan\\'s rural municipalities.\\nCanada\\'s two largest hamlets—Fort McMurray (formerly incorporated as a city) and Sherwood Park—are located in Alberta. They each have populations, within their main urban area, in excess of 60,000—well in excess of the 10,000-person threshold that can choose to incorporate as a city in Alberta. As such, these two hamlets have been further designated by the Province of Alberta as urban service areas. An urban service area is recognized as equivalent to a city for the purposes of provincial and federal program delivery and grant eligibility.\\n\\n\\n=== France ===\\n\\nA hamlet, French: hameau, is a group of rural dwellings, usually too small to be considered a village. The term Lieu-dit is also applied to hamlets, but this can also refer to uninhabited localities.\\nDuring the 18th century, it was fashionable for rich or noble people to create their own hameau in their gardens. This was a group of houses or farms with rustic appearance, but in fact very comfortable. The best known are the Hameau de la Reine built by the queen Marie-Antoinette in the park of the Château de Versailles, and the Hameau de Chantilly built by Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé in Chantilly, Oise.\\n\\n\\n=== Germany ===\\n\\nThe German word for hamlet is Weiler (German: [ˈva͡ɪlɐ]). A Weiler has, compared to a Dorf (village), no infrastructure (i.e. no inn, no school, no store, no church). The houses and farms of a Weiler can be grouped (in the hills and the mountains) or scattered (more often in the plains). In North West Germany, a group of scattered farms is called Bauerschaft. In a Weiler, there are no street names, the houses are just numbered.\\nThere is no legal definition of a hamlet in Germany. In Bavaria, like in Austria, a Weiler is defined as a settlement with 3 to 9 dwellings, from 10 houses it is called a village. A hamlet does not usually form its own administrative unit, but is part of a larger municipality.\\n\\n\\n=== India ===\\nIn different states of India, there are different words for h'], 'The Hamlet': ['The Hamlet is a novel by the American author William Faulkner, published in 1940, about the fictional Snopes family of Mississippi. Originally a standalone novel, it was later followed by The Town (1957) and The Mansion (1959), forming the Snopes trilogy.\\n\\n\\n== Composition ==\\nThe novel incorporates revised versions of the previously-published short stories \"Spotted Horses\" (1931, Book Four\\'s Chapter One), \"The Hound\" (1931, Book Three\\'s Chapter Two), \"Lizards in Jamshyd\\'s Courtyard\" (1932, Book One\\'s Chapter Three and Book Four\\'s Chapter Two), and \"Fool About a Horse\" (1936, Book One\\'s Chapter Two). It also makes use of material from \"Father Abraham\" (abandoned 1927, pub. 1984, Book Four\\'s Chapter One), \"Afternoon of a Cow\" (1937, pub. 1943, Book Three\\'s Chapter Two), and \"Barn Burning\" (1939, Book One\\'s Chapter One).\\n\\n\\n== Plot summary ==\\n\\nThe novel follows the exploits of the Snopes family, beginning with Ab Snopes, who is introduced more fully in Faulkner\\'s The Unvanquished. Most of the book centers on Frenchman\\'s Bend, into which the heirs of Ab and his family have migrated from parts unknown. In the beginning of the book, Ab, his wife, daughter, and son Flem settle down as tenant farmers beholden to the powerful Varner family.\\nAs the book progresses, the Snopeses move from being poor outcasts to a very controversial, if not dangerous, element in the life of the town. In contrast, V.K. Ratliff stands as the moral hero of the novel. Faulkner uses the eccentricities of the Snopeses to great comic effect, most notably in his description of Ike Snopes and his carnal inclinations toward a cow.\\n\\n\\n=== Book One: \"Flem\" ===\\n\\n\\n==== Chapter One ====\\n\\n\\n===== Part 1 (which is the only part) =====\\nFrenchman\\'s Bend/The Old Frenchman Place introduced: lawlessness; socioeconomic background of settlers. Will Varner, Jody Varner introduced. Ab Snopes rents a place from Jody; is discovered via gossip to be an alleged barn-burner. First glimpse of Eula (p. 11). Jody plans to force Ab out after getting work out of him. Ab is discovered to be mixed up in a second incident of barn-burning, over a dispute with de Spain over his wife\\'s expensive French carpet. Jody agrees to take on Flem as a clerk in the Varner store to keep Ab happy.\\n\\n\\n==== Chapter Two ====\\n\\n\\n===== Part 1 =====\\nRatliff is introduced; he claims he knew Ab a long time ago.\\n\\n\\n===== Part 2 =====\\nRatliff discusses Ab\\'s past, before he was \"soured\". Ab trades horses with Pat Stamper. Ab\\'s motive is to recover the eight Yoknapatawpha County dollars that Stamper had acquired from Beasly. Ab picks up his wife\\'s milk separator; trades Pat Stamper several teams, and comes out much the worse.\\n\\n\\n===== Part 3 =====\\nRatliff takes Ab a bottle of McCallum\\'s whiskey.\\n\\n\\n==== Chapter Three ====\\n\\n\\n===== Part 1 =====\\nFlem settles into clerking at Varner\\'s store. Ratliff is established as a gossipmonger, a speculative capitalist, a traveler. Flem disrupts the normal business practices of the Varner store by insisting on payment up front and always calculating the bill correctly. Flem has a bow tie (64). Flem quickly establishes himself as upwardly mobile. Flem establishes a cow-trading sideline; I.O. and Eck Snopes appear on the Frenchman\\'s Bend scene. The old blacksmith, Trumbull, is forced out. Jody wonders how much he\\'ll have to pay in order to keep himself safe from the rumor of Ab\\'s barn-burning.\\n\\n\\n===== Part 2 =====\\nRatliff is recovering from an operation; catches up on local gossip. Flem is making usurious loans to Negroes; I.O. is to be the new schoolteacher. Mink Snopes appears for the first time; he trades a note bearing the name \"Ike Snopes\" for a sewing machine. Ratliff tells the story of the goat-scarcity caused by the Northerner\\'s goat-ranching plans. Ike Snopes turns out to be an idiot; Flem redeems his note; Mrs. Littlejohn watches after Ike, as she can communicate with him somehow.\\n\\n\\n===== Part 3 =====\\nFlem \"passes\" Jody Varner at the store; apparently, he means to pass Will Varner, as w']}, What did Petra van Staveren win a gold medal for?: {'Petra van Staveren': ['Petronella (\"Petra\") Grietje van Staveren (born 2 June 1966) is a former breaststroke swimmer from the Netherlands who won the gold medal in the 100 meter breaststroke at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.\\nJobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak\\'s Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. \\nJobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing industry in 1985 (for example, the Aldus Pagemaker) with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript.\\nIn 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company\\'s board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets, serving as its CEO. In 1986, he helped develop the visual effects industry by funding the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm that eventually spun off independently as Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and became a leading animation studio, producing 28 films since.\\nIn 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company\\'s acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the \"Think different\" advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App Store, and iPad. Jobs was also a board member at Gap Inc. from 1999 to 2002. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. He died of tumor-related respiratory arrest in 2011; in 2022, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Since his death, he has won 141 patents; Jobs holds over 450 patents in total.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family ===\\nSteven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah \"John\" Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي). Abdulfattah Jandali was born in a Muslim household to wealthy Syrian parents, the youngest of nine siblings. After obtaining his undergraduate degree at the American University of Beirut, Jandali pursued a PhD in political science at the University of Wisconsin. There, he met Joanne Schieble, an American Catholic of Swiss-German descent whose parents owned a mink farm and real estate in Green Bay. The two fell in love but faced opposition from Schieble\\'s father due to Jandali\\'s Muslim faith. When Schieble became pregnant, she arranged for a closed adoption, and travelled to San Francisco to give birth.\\nSchieble requested that her son be adopted by college graduates. A lawyer and his wife were selected, but they withdrew after discovering that the baby was a boy, so Jobs was instead adopted by Paul Reinhold and Clara (née Hagopian) Jobs. Paul Jobs, an American of German descent, was the son of a dairy farmer from Washington County, Wisconsin. After dropping out of high s'], 'Steve Jobs (film)': ['Steve Jobs is a 2015 biographical drama film directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin. A British-American co-production, it was adapted from the 2011 biography by Walter Isaacson and interviews conducted by Sorkin. The film covers fourteen years in the life of Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, specifically ahead of three press conferences he gave during that time - the formal unveiling of the Macintosh 128K on January 24, 1984, the unveiling of the NeXT Computer on October 12, 1988, and the unveiling of the iMac G3 on May 6, 1998. Jobs is portrayed by Michael Fassbender, with Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman, Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak, and Jeff Daniels as John Sculley in supporting roles.\\nDevelopment began in 2011 after the rights to Isaacson\\'s book were acquired. Filming began in January 2015. A variety of actors were considered and cast before Fassbender eventually took the role. Editing was extensive on the project, with editor Elliot Graham starting while the film was still shooting. Daniel Pemberton served as composer, with a focus on dividing the score into three distinguishable sections.\\nSteve Jobs premiered at the 2015 Telluride Film Festival on September 5, 2015, and began a limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on October 9, 2015. It opened nationwide in the U.S. on October 23, 2015, to widespread critical acclaim, with Boyle\\'s direction, visual style, Sorkin\\'s screenplay, musical score, cinematography, editing and the acting of Fassbender, Winslet, Rogen and Daniels garnering unanimous acclaim. However, it was a financial disappointment, grossing only $34 million worldwide against a budget of $30 million. People close to Jobs such as Steve Wozniak and John Sculley praised the performances, but the film also received criticism for historical inaccuracy. Steve Jobs was nominated for Best Actor (Fassbender) and Best Supporting Actress (Winslet) at the 88th Academy Awards, and received numerous other accolades.\\n\\n\\n== Plot ==\\nIn 1984, the Apple Macintosh 128K\\'s voice demo fails less than an hour before its unveiling at Flint Center. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs demands engineer Andy Hertzfeld to fix it, threatening to publicly implicate him in the presentation\\'s credits if he does not. Hertzfeld finally suggests faking the demo by using the prototype Macintosh 512K computer.\\nJobs rants to marketing executive Joanna Hoffman about a Time magazine article exposing his paternity dispute with ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan as he denies he is the father of Brennan\\'s five-year-old daughter, Lisa. Brennan arrives with Lisa to confront him – she is bitter over his denials and refusal to support her despite his wealth. Jobs bonds with Lisa over her MacPaint art and agrees to provide more money and a house. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak asks Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team in his presentation, but Jobs feels that mentioning the computer (which he considers obsolete) is unwise.\\nBy 1986, following the Macintosh\\'s apparent failure, Jobs has founded a new company, NeXT. Before the NeXT Computer launch at the War Memorial Opera House in 1988, he spends time with 9-year-old Lisa. However, his relationship with Brennan is still strained. He accuses her of irresponsible behavior and using Lisa to get money from him. Wozniak arrives and predicts the NeXT will be another failure. Jobs confronts him about his public criticism of him, and Wozniak questions Jobs\\' contributions to computing history. Jobs defends his role as that of a conductor who directs \"musicians\" like Wozniak.\\nApple CEO John Sculley demands to know why the world believes he fired Jobs – Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board, who were resolute on updating the Apple II following the Macintosh\\'s lackluster sales. Despite Sculley\\'s warnings, Jobs criticized the decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure. After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT\\'s unclear direction, she realizes Jobs designed the computer to entice Apple to buy the ']}}\n"

Its overseas regions and territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean, giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world. Metropolitan France shares borders with Belgium and Luxembourg to the north, Germany to the northeast, Switzerland to the east, Italy and Monaco to the southeast, Andorra and Spain to the south, and a maritime border with the United Kingdom to the northwest. Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea. Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and have a total population of 68.4 million as of January 2024. France is a semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre.\n",
            "Metropolitan France was settled during the Iron Age by Celtic tribes known as Gauls before Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture. In the Early Middle Ages, the Franks formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia evolving into the Kingdom of France. In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but decentralized feudal kingdom, but from the mid-14th to the mid-15th centuries, France was plunged into a dynastic conflict with England known as the Hundred Years' War. In the 16th century, the French Renaissance saw culture flourish and a French colonial empire rise. Internally, France was dominated by the conflict with the House of Habsburg and the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Huguenots. France was successful in the Thirty Years' War and further increased its influence during the reign of Louis XIV.\n",
            "The French Revolution of 1789 overthrew the Ancien Régime and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating part of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured the Bourbon Restoration until the founding of the French Second Republic which was succeeded by the Second French Empire upon Napoleon III's takeover. His empire collapsed during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. This led to the establishment of the Third French Republic, and subsequent decades saw a period of economic prosperity and cultural and scientific flourishing known as the Belle Époque. France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious at great human and economic cost. It was among the Allies of World War II, but it surrendered and was occupied in 1940. Following its liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the defeat in the Algerian War. The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle. Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France.\n",

            "France, officially the French Republic, is a country located primarily in Western Europe. Its overseas regions and territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean, giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world. Metropolitan France shares borders with Belgium and Luxembourg to the north, Germany to the northeast, Switzerland to the east, Italy and Monaco to the southeast, Andorra and Spain to the south, and a maritime border with the United Kingdom to the northwest. Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea. Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and have a total population of 68.4 million as of January 2024. France is a semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre.\n",
            "Metropolitan France was settled during the Iron Age by Celtic tribes known as Gauls before Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture. In the Early Middle Ages, the Franks formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia evolving into the Kingdom of France. In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but decentralized feudal kingdom, but from the mid-14th to the mid-15th centuries, France was plunged into a dynastic conflict with England known as the Hundred Years' War. In the 16th century, the French Renaissance saw culture flourish and a French colonial empire rise. Internally, France was dominated by the conflict with the House of Habsburg and the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Huguenots. France was successful in the Thirty Years' War and further increased its influence during the reign of Louis XIV.\n",
            "The French Revolution of 1789 overthrew the Ancien Régime and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating part of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured the Bourbon Restoration until the founding of the French Second Republic which was succeeded by the Second French Empire upon Napoleon III's takeover. His empire collapsed during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. This led to the establishment of the Third French Republic, and subsequent decades saw a period of economic prosperity and cultural and scientific flourishing known as the Belle Époque. France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious at great human and economic cost. It was among the Allies of World War II, but it surrendered and was occupied in 1940. Following its liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the defeat in the Algerian War. The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle. Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France.\n",
            "France retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science, and philosophy. It hosts the fourth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the world's leading tourist destination, receiving 100 million foreign visitors in 2023. A developed country, France has a high nominal per capita income globally, and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world. It is a great power, being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state. France is a founding\n"
