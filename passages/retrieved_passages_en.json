Three cyano groups of the cyanate ester are trimerized to a triazine ring structure, hence the T in the name. In presence of a bismaleimide, the double bond of the maleimide group can copolymerize with the cyano groups to heterocyclic 6-membered aromatic ring structures with two nitrogen atoms (pyrimidines). The cure reaction occurs at temperatures up to 250 degrees C, and is catalyzed by strongly basic molecules like Dabco (diazabicyclooctane) and 4-DMAP (4-dimethylaminopyridin). Products with very high glass transition temperatures (Tg)- up to 300 degrees C -  and very low dielectric constant can be obtained.

However, the personal prestige of the first two presidents, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk and Edvard Bene\u0161, and the instability of successive governments (for example, Masaryk's presidency saw 10 cabinets headed by nine statesmen) meant that the president wielded in practice more authority than the plain text of the constitution suggested. The constitution laid down that all executive functions rested with the government except as expressly assigned to the president. However, the president could address written or verbal messages to parliament, appoint and dismiss ministers, attend and preside over cabinet meetings, and demand written reports from individual ministers.

Commissioners and Directors-General were referred to by their title (in French) with greater prestige for those of higher ranks. As one former servant, Derk Jan Eppink has put it, even after new staff had passed the tough entrance exams: \"Those at the top counted for everything. Those at the bottom counted for nothing.\" One example of this was the chef de cabinet of President Jacques Delors, Pascal Lamy, who was particularly notable for his immense influence over other civil servants.

However, the color of this species does have variation, which usually depends on where in Africa a particular specimen is found.

Specimens from other areas can be yellow, pinkish, pink-grey, pale red or steel grey. Most specimens will have a throat band, but it will fade or even sometimes disappear in larger adults. The true red specimens will become reddish-brown in colour as they age and grow in size. The body of this snake is slightly depressed, tapered and moderately slender with a medium-length tail.

Since Pachappa hill was designated as the southeast marker of the Jurupa Rancho, which was granted by the Mexican government to Juan Bandini in 1838, reassigning the name to the current Pachappa Hill would have expanded the Rancho Jurupa significantly, incorporating all of the area covered by today's downtown Riverside.

Although this naming is considered illegitimate due to article 53.1 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, Peck is still given as the authority in the Bessette et al.

This taxonomic conflict has yet to be resolved. In 1909 a species found in Singapore was named Boletus bicolor by George Edward Massee; this naming is illegitimate and is synonymous with Boletochaete bicolor according to Singer. Molecular studies found that Boletus bicolor was not closely related to the type species of Boletus, Boletus edulis, and in 2015 Alfredo Vizzini transferred Boletus bicolor to the genus Baorangia.

This study also found that when participants were using articulatory suppression, the verbal overshadowing effect did not occur. This would seem to suggest that the encoding of faces and the verbal overshadowing effect comes from a problem with the verbal code, not the visual code. Because having that distracter syllable did not hinder the individual's ability to recognize the face more than describing it did, it would not be a problem with disrupting what the participants encoded visually, but the verbal aspects that interferes and creates the verbal overshadowing effect.",

These substances, found specifically in male pheromones, are responsible for aggregation of the insects to aid in sexual reproduction and can also be used in warning predators.

For females, the pheromone is used as a sex-pheromone to attract mates. Other males use a different version of this pheromone to aggregate more males to a given area to signal the availability of food and it serves a similar purpose with nymphs.

It praised various aspects of the game, including the responsive controls, the graphics as having \"stood the test of time\", the soundtrack as an \"audio masterpiece\" (giving the sound a 100% score), the \"vocal performances\" and \"dubbing\" as surpassing \"most gaming dubs produced today\", the \"fantastical world\", and the \"story of tragedy, hope and life\".

He joined the club in 1968 to promote anti-discrimination. The Highland Country Club at Pacific and 132nd Streets was renamed Iron Wood in 2000.  It no longer specifies Jewish-only membership, just as most other country clubs no longer exclude Jewish Americans or other minorities. The Omaha Jewish Community Center was founded two years after the country club, in 1926.  The JCC moved to its present location at 333 South 132nd Street in 1973.

The ossicles act as the mechanical analog of an electrical transformer, matching the mechanical impedance of vibrations in air to vibrations in the liquid of the cochlea. The net effect of this impedance matching is to greatly increase the overall sensitivity and upper frequency limits of mammalian hearing, as compared to reptilian hearing. The details of these structures and their effects vary noticeably between different mammal species, even when the species are as closely related as humans and chimpanzees.",

When Father Eusebio Kino first arrived in the area in 1691 he was greeted by leaders of this group. Headmen from San Cayetano del Tumac\u00e1cori and perhaps other villages had come to Saric, Mexico from the north to ask that Kino visit them. Kino traveled north along the Santa Cruz River to San Cayetano de Tumac\u00e1cori (later moved to the modern location of Tumac\u00e1cori National Historical Park and renamed), where he found three native-made structures that had been constructed specially for him: a house, a kitchen, and one for saying mass (Bolton 1948). This visit to this first of the Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert north of the current international border made this native Sobaipuri settlement the first mission in southern Arizona, or the first Jesuit mission in Arizona, but, contrary to popular notions, not the first mission in Arizona. This original native Sobaipuri settlement of San Cayetano del Tumac\u00e1cori has been located archaeologically on the east side of the river (as shown on Kino's historic maps), providing evidence of a densely packed, well-planned, long-occupied village (Seymour 2007a, 2011a).",

This was a special honor, as his taking up the posting in October 310 coincided with the very day five years before when Maxentius was acclaimed as emperor. From September 311 until the end of the year, he was the consul of Maxentius alongside Aradius Rufinus. This may have been an attempt to appease the aristocracy of Rome who were becoming discontented with Maxentius\u2019 rule. With the defeat and death of Maxentius at the hands of Constantine I in 312, Volusianus transferred his loyalty to the new emperor. He was recognized as one of the Comiti domini nostri Constantini invicti et perpetui semper Augusti (or Companion of the emperor Constantine), making him one of several senators who served under both Maxentius and Constantine, and his subsequent career under Constantine showed that the emperor was conscious of the need to win over the loyalty of the senatorial elite in Rome.",

                "Seth Read. After the war we find references to Seth Read in the early records of Worcester County and the Town of Uxbridge. He remained active in the local political life. Colonel Seth Read served in the Massachusetts General Court, or State Legislature from 1784 to 1786. In March 1786, Seth Reed petitioned the Massachusetts General Court, both the House and the Senate, for a franchise to mint coins, both copper and silver, and \"it was concurred\" (Massachusetts Coppers). According to the U.S. Treasury Colonel Reed of Uxbridge, Massachusetts was said to be instrumental in having E Pluribus Unum placed on United States coins. The phrase is placed on all U.S. coins. The phrase \"E Pluribus unum\", \"Out of Many, One,\", is now considered the traditional motto of the United States. The United States Treasury was first organized in 1789. The first official U.S. money with printing which included E Pluribus Unum was in 1795, and possibly as early as 1791. The first use of e pluribus unum on any U.S. coins was trace\"d to copper coins minted at Newburg New York in 1786. The text which cites these earlier printings, again attributes use of e pluribus unum on US coins to Colonel Read of Uxbridge, Mass. Modern US coins have the phrase on the reverse side of the coin, (see the infobox of the one cent coin below where the inscription \"E Pluribus Unum\" appears above the Lincoln Memorial). The inaugural journey of President George Washington through New England in 1789 mentions the President's intent to visit his friend Colonel Read on passing through Uxbridge. But Colonel Reed was out of town reportedly moving his family to upstate Geneva, New York. Colonel Reed was reported to be a great landowner in Uxbridge. Another indicator of Seth Read's prominence in early Uxbridge was this citation. Referring to the Capron house in Uxbridge, \"This house was built by Col. Seth Read, who once owned most of the real estate in this village\" The biography of Seth Read and his descendants describes that Colonel Seth Read and his brother, Colonel Joseph Read owned half of the land in the town of Uxbridge, and in the town of Northbridge. Their two houses were within a mile and a half of each other on either side of the town common in Uxbridge. But during the war their financial fortunes took a severe reversal and these two entrepreneurial adventurous men returned to Uxbridge to a relative state of poverty.",

In a rage, Alexander threw the coins at horses, asking what help this would be to a hungry army. Alexander shouted \"What good have you done having brought this?\". Thereafter Abulites was jailed by Alexander. Some of these coins may have been the \"Porus\" coins of Alexander, struck in 325-323 BC in Babylon or Susa, which often bear the initials \"AB\" and \"\u039e\", possibly identified with the initials of Abulites and his associated Macedonian general Xenophilus.",

This is exemplified by how the Slavic saints of that time are referred to up to nowadays: e.g. St. Boris and Gleb, in holy baptism Roman and David. As the Slavic saints became more numerous, more traditional names entered the Church calendar; but more prominent was the overall decline in the number of people bearing traditional names.

The scientific objectives of the mission have been achieved. The YES2 featured the first multi-stage tether deployment. It could be reconstructed within about 20 m accuracy for the first stage (3400 m) and 100\u2013150 m for the 31.7\u00a0km deployment as a whole. The first stage was deployed accurately (about 10\u201320 m error), the second stage overdeployed by 1.7\u00a0km. Fotino released as planned during a swing of the tethered system through the vertical (as seen from Foton). The tether properties, deployment dynamics and tether deployer system performance could be evaluated. The tether deployer performed nominally. However, due to an electrical fault, the on-board computer failed to register the final length correctly and only a partial deployment was initially reported based on telemetry available in real-time. Initial deployment friction was found to exceed the nominal range, revealed by post-mission testing to be most likely due to a thermomechanical settling of the tether spool   Some weeks after mission completion, analysis of the full data set confirmed that the tether deployed to its full length of 31.7\u00a0km. No signal was ever received from the \"Fotino\" re-entry capsule after separation, and it was lost.  YES2 established a new world record as the longest artificial structure in space and was later included in the Guinness Book of Records Edition 2009.",

In Citrus, polyembryony is genetically controlled by a shared polyembryony locus among the species, determined by single-nucleotide polymorphism in the genotypes sequenced. The variation within the species of citrus is based on the amount of embryos that develop, the impact of the environment, and gene expression.

He was the first scientist to demonstrate that foreign teratocarcinoma cells could combine with native blastocyst cells to form adult \"chimeric\" mice, demonstrating the feasibility of this novel approach to change the genetic character of mice (Fig. 2). The introduction of foreign cells and new genes into these chimeric mice generated the first prototype transgenic animals. In addition, this discovery stimulated the search for embryonic stem cells and ultimately led to the development of the \"knock-out mouse\".",

The same supply problems that delayed the Beaufort ended any chance of the RAAF acquiring Beaufighters for the time being, and it wasn't until the end of 1942 that plans began to be laid for Beaufighter production. The Australian Government gave the go-ahead for manufacture of 350 Beaufighters on 30 January 1943 and preparations got underway in earnest. As the supply of engines from Britain was still uncertain at that time, a Bristol-built aircraft was re-engined with Wright GR-2600 Cyclones as insurance; in the event all Australian-built Beaufighters were fitted with imported Bristol Hercules engines. The first DAP Beaufighter flew for the first time on 26 May 1944 and production and deliveries slightly overlapped those of Beauforts, with the first two dozen Beaufighters being built and delivered concurrently with the last fifty-or-so Beauforts.

They are not closely related to any living mammals. Mesonychid taxonomy has long been disputed and they have captured popular imagination as \"wolves on hooves,\" animals that combine features of both ungulates and carnivores. Skulls and teeth have similar features to early whales, and the family was long thought to be the ancestors of cetaceans. Recent fossil discoveries have overturned this idea; the consensus is that whales are highly derived artiodactyls. Some researchers now consider the family a sister group either to whales or to artiodactyls, close relatives rather than direct ancestors. Other studies define Mesonychia as basal to all ungulates, occupying a position between Perissodactyla and Ferae. In this case, the resemblances to early whales would be due to convergent evolution among ungulate-like herbivores that developed adaptations related to hunting or eating meat.",

The name of the band was taken from the lyrics (by Johnny Morrow of Iron Monkey) of \"Big Loader,\" a song on the debut album Iron Monkey. Greaves even used \"Crippled Black Phoenix\" as a pseudonym.

Vack\u00e1\u0159 analyzes the circuit and explains how to get an approximately constant amplitude response. The circuit's transconductance increases linearly with frequency, but that increase is offset by the tuning inductor's increasing . This circuit has become known as the Vack\u00e1\u0159 VFO. Vack\u00e1\u0159 referred to the circuit as \"our circuit\" and states that O. Landini independently discovered the circuit and published it (without an analysis) in Radio Rivista in 1948. Vack\u00e1\u0159 describes a VFO design using this circuit that covers a modest frequency range of 1:1.17.",

When elder brother Ashraf Ghani, became president in 2014, the younger Ghani did not let up on commenting on what he saw as flaws or missed opportunities among the national unity government, a special setup which saw Ashraf Ghani become President and his primary rival Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, given the new title of Chief Executive.",

                "L-shell. However, for particles which mirror at safe altitudes, (in yet a further level of approximation) the fact that the field generally increases towards the center of the Earth means that the curvature on the side of the orbit nearest the Earth is somewhat greater than on the opposite side, so that the orbit has a slightly non-circular, with a (prolate) cycloidal shape, and the guiding center slowly moves perpendicular both to the field line and to the radial direction.  The guiding center of the cyclotron orbit, instead of moving exactly along the field line, therefore drifts slowly east or west (depending on the sign of the charge of the particle), and the local field line connecting the two mirror points at any moment, slowly sweeps out a surface connecting them as it moves in longitude.  Eventually the particle will drift entirely around the Earth, and the surface will be closed upon itself.  These drift surfaces, nested like the skin of an onion, are the surfaces of constant L\u00a0 in the McIlwain coordinate system.  They apply not only for a perfect dipole field, but also for fields that are approximately dipolar.  For a given particle, as long as only the Lorentz force is involved, B\u00a0 and L\u00a0 remain constant and particles can be trapped indefinitely.  Use of (B,L)\u00a0 coordinates provides us with a way of mapping the real, non-dipolar terrestrial or planetary field into coordinates that behave essentially like those of a perfect dipole.  The L\u00a0 parameter is traditionally labeled in Earth-radii, of the point where the shell crosses the magnetic Equator, of the equivalent dipole.  B\u00a0 is measured in gauss.",

Once each object was centred in one set of sights, the reading could be taken.  This could be a challenge for a moving star observed with a very large instrument as a single person might not be able to confirm both sights with ease; an assistant was a great benefit.

Mesonychid taxonomy has long been disputed and they have captured popular imagination as \"wolves on hooves,\" animals that combine features of both ungulates and carnivores. Skulls and teeth have similar features to early whales, and the family was long thought to be the ancestors of cetaceans. Recent fossil discoveries have overturned this idea; the consensus is that whales are highly derived artiodactyls. Some researchers now consider the family a sister group either to whales or to artiodactyls, close relatives rather than direct ancestors. Other studies define Mesonychia as basal to all ungulates, occupying a position between Perissodactyla and Ferae. In this case, the resemblances to early whales would be due to convergent evolution among ungulate-like herbivores that developed adaptations related to hunting or eating meat.",

He was a professor of political science at the Takshashila University of ancient India, and later the prime minister of the Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya. He wrote the Arthashastra (\"Science of Material Gain\" or \"''Science of political economy\" in Sanskrit). Many of the topics discussed in the Arthashastra are still prevalent in modern economics, including its discussions on the management of an efficient and solid economy, and the ethics of economics. Chanakya also focuses on issues of welfare (for instance, redistribution of wealth during a famine) and the collective ethics that hold a society together.",

However, in 1964 Joseph J.
