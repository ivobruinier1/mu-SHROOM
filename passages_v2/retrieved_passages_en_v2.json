The organization Pythagoras founded at Croton was called a \"school\", but, in many ways, resembled a monastery. The adherents were bound by a vow to Pythagoras and each other, for the purpose of pursuing the religious and ascetic observances, and of studying his religious and philosophical theories. The members of the sect shared all their possessions in common and were devoted to each other to the exclusion of outsiders.",

Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Illuminati, was a strong admirer of Pythagoras and, in his book Pythagoras (1787), he advocated that society should be reformed to be more like Pythagoras's commune at Croton. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart incorporated Masonic and Pythagorean symbolism into his opera The Magic Flute. Sylvain Mar\u00e9chal, in his six-volume 1799 biography The Voyages of Pythagoras, declared that all revolutionaries in all time periods are the \"heirs of Pythagoras\".     On literature   Dante Alighieri was fascinated by Pythagorean numerology and based his descriptions of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven on Pythagorean numbers.",

Despite the publicity of being Elizabeth Taylor's husband and the large amounts of money Warner used in his campaign for the nomination, he finished second at the state Republican Party (GOP) convention to the far more conservative politician Richard D.

Official report  The official report from BEA concluded that the probable cause of the accident was a combination of the following:  Very low flyover height, lower than surrounding obstacles; Speed very slow and reducing to reach maximum possible angle of attack; Engines speed at flight idle; and Late application of go-around power. Furthermore, the bureau concluded that if the descent below 100 feet was not deliberate, it may have resulted from a failure by the crew to take proper account of the visual and aural information available to them regarding the elevation \"above ground level\" (AGL) of the aircraft. The report further recommended that:  Passengers should be banned from all demonstration flights Flight crews should be provided with \u2013 and ensure \u2013 proper reconnaissance of airfields Airline company procedures should be reviewed to ensure they comply with official regulations concerning altitude    Prosecutions  In 1996, Captain Asseline, First Officer Mazi\u00e8res, two Air France officials and the president of the flying club sponsoring the air show were all charged with involuntary manslaughter.

In 1926 Willis wrote a paper defending his hypothesis and responded to the criticism. Most scientists, however, had rejected the hypothesis for various reasons and according to the historian of science Charles H. Smith \"The \"age and area\" theory attracted some interest for about twenty years, but support for it was clearly on the wane by the time of Willis's late books The Course of Evolution and The Birth and Spread of Plants (though each of these works contained some interesting ideas).\"     The Course of Evolution  Willis published a controversial book on evolution The Course of Evolution by Differentiation Or Divergent Mutation Rather Than by Selection (1940) which was a sequel to his Age and Area.",

The rapid modernization during the Meiji era was not without its opponents, as the rapid changes to society caused many disaffected traditionalists from the former samurai class to rebel against the Meiji government during the 1870s, most famously Saig\u014d Takamori, who led the Satsuma Rebellion. However, there were also former samurai who remained loyal while serving in the Meiji government, such as It\u014d Hirobumi and Itagaki Taisuke.

Taxonomy  The brown-headed cowbird was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1775 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in the Carolinas. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-colored plate engraved by Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin\u00e9es D'Histoire Naturelle, which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text.

A study of nests of Bell's vireo highlighted a potential limitation of these control programs, demonstrating that removal of cowbirds from a site may create an unintended consequence of increasing cowbird productivity on that site, because with fewer cowbirds, fewer parasitized nests are deserted, resulting in greater nest success for cowbirds.

The 80D is the first non-professional EOS body that can autofocus in this situation; previous non-professional bodies could not autofocus if the maximum aperture of an attached lens/teleconverter combination was smaller than f/5.6.",

Sources agree that the name is from Ojibwe, but differ on the original meaning. The county's website suggests it meant \"body of water hanging on high,\" but an 1884 military annal said it meant \"water-mold lake\" (Agogibing).",

Before World War II, Jews made up a large percentage of the population in O\u017car\u00f3w. According to historical records, in 1931, out of a total population of approximately 4,500 people, around 2,800 were Jewish.\n\nThe Jewish community in O\u017car\u00f3w had a rich cultural and religious life. They had their own synagogue, schools, and various organizations. The town also had a large market where Jews sold textiles, leather goods, and other merchandise.\n\nHowever, during the Holocaust, most of the Jewish population was killed or forced to flee. In 1942, the Nazis established a labor camp in O\u017car\u00f3w, which was later transformed into a concentration camp. Thousands of Jews from various parts of Poland were brought there and subjected to forced labor, starvation, and brutal treatment. Many died from disease or were killed during mass shootings. By the end of the war, only a few hundred Jews survived out of the pre-war population of around 2,800.\n\nToday, there are several sites in O\u017car\u00f3w that commemorate its Jewish history. These include the ruins of the synagogue, which have been turned into a memorial site, and the Jewish cemetery, which has been restored and is now a protected monument.

For the Jews of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the yeshivot of Babylonia served much the same function as the ancient Sanhedrin\u2014that is, as a council of Jewish religious authorities. The academies were founded in pre-Islamic Babylonia under the Zoroastrian Sassanid dynasty and were located not far from the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon, which at that time was the largest city in the world. After the conquest of Persia in the 7th century, the academies subsequently operated for four hundred years under the Islamic caliphate. The first gaon of Sura, according to Sherira Gaon, was Mar bar Rab Chanan, who assumed office in 609. The last gaon of Sura was Samuel ben Hofni, who died in 1034; the last gaon of Pumbedita was Hezekiah Gaon, who was tortured to death in 1040; hence the activity of the Geonim covers a period of nearly 450 years.",

At Huzal, near Nehardea, there was another synagogue, not far from which could be seen the ruins of Ezra's academy. In the period before Hadrian, Akiba, on his arrival at Nehardea on a mission from the Sanhedrin, entered into a discussion with a resident scholar on a point of matrimonial law (Mishnah Yeb., end). At the same time there was at Nisibis (northern Mesopotamia), an excellent Jewish college, at the head of which stood Judah ben Bathyra, and in which many Judean scholars found refuge at the time of the persecutions. A certain temporary importance was also attained by a school at Nehar-Pekod, founded by the Judean immigrant Hananiah, nephew of Joshua ben Hananiah, which school might have been the cause of a schism between the Jews of Babylonia and those of Judea-Israel, had not the Judean authorities promptly checked Hananiah's ambition.

Archaeological finds also provide evidence for the later cooperation of these two kingdoms in their coalition against Aram, and for their destructions by the Assyrians and later by the Babylonians. Genetic studies on Jews show that most Jews worldwide bear a common genetic heritage which originates in the Middle East, and that they share certain genetic traits with other Gentile peoples of the Fertile Crescent. The genetic composition of different Jewish groups shows that Jews share a common gene pool dating back four millennia, as a marker of their common ancestral origin. Despite their long-term separation, Jewish communities maintained their unique commonalities, propensities, and sensibilities in culture, tradition, and language.    ",

The monotypic and highly distinct Cedronella (Canary balm) of Macaronesia is slightly more distant and seems to be a basal relict within the subtribe. Thus, the last common ancestor of Agastache and its closest relatives probably was an aromatic Eastern Asian perennial or subshrub with verticillasters of bluish-purple flowers \u2013 i.e. generally very similar to the present-day Agastache already.

The alternative of sustained countrywide pacification operations, which would require massive use of US manpower, was never available to Westmoreland, because it was considered politically unacceptable. In public, Westmoreland continued to be sanguine about the progress being made throughout his time in Vietnam, though supportive journalist James Reston thought Westmoreland's characterizing of the conflict as attrition warfare presented his generalship in a misleading light.

                "Sergei Prokofiev. He now preferred what he called a \"new simplicity\", which he found more sincere than the \"contrivances and complexities\" of so much modern music of the 1920s. In 1928\u201329, Prokofiev composed his last ballet for Diaghilev, The Prodigal Son. When first staged in Paris on 21 May 1929, choreographed by George Balanchine with Serge Lifar in the title role, the audience and critics were particularly struck by the final scene, in which the prodigal son drags himself across the stage on his knees to be welcomed by his father. Diaghilev had recognised that in the music to the scene, Prokofiev had \"never been more clear, more simple, more melodious, and more tender\". Only months later, Diaghilev died.",

                "Sergei Prokofiev. Forced to adapt to the new circumstances (whatever private misgivings he had about them), Prokofiev wrote a series of \"mass songs\" (Opp. 66, 79, 89), using the lyrics of officially approved Soviet poets. In 1938, he collaborated with Eisenstein on the historical epic Alexander Nevsky, composing some of his most inventive and dramatic music. Although the film had very poor sound recording, Prokofiev adapted much of his score into a large-scale cantata for mezzo-soprano, orchestra and chorus, which was extensively performed and recorded. In the wake of Alexander Nevsky's success, Prokofiev composed his first Soviet opera, Semyon Kotko, which was intended to be produced by the director Vsevolod Meyerhold. The opera's premi\u00e8re was postponed because Meyerhold was arrested on 20 June 1939 by the NKVD, and shot on 2 February 1940.",

                "Sergei Prokofiev. Premiered respectively by Prokofiev (No. 6: 8 April 1940), Sviatoslav Richter (No. 7: Moscow, 18 January 1943) and Emil Gilels (No. 8: Moscow, 30 December 1944), they were subsequently championed in particular by Richter. Biographer Daniel Jaff\u00e9 argued that Prokofiev, \"having forced himself to compose a cheerful evocation of the nirvana Stalin wanted everyone to believe he had created\" (i.e. in Zdravitsa) then subsequently, in the three sonatas, \"expressed his true feelings\". As evidence, Jaff\u00e9 has pointed out that the central movement of Sonata No. 7 opens with a theme based on the Robert Schumann lied \"Wehmut\" (\"Sadness\", from the Liederkreis, Op. 39): its words translate, \"I can sometimes sing as if I were glad, yet secretly tears well and so free my heart. Nightingales \u2026 sing their song of longing from their dungeon's depth \u2026 everyone delights, yet no one feels the pain, the deep sorrow in the song.\"",

The use of the term dharm\u0101stik\u0101ya to mean motion and to refer to an ontological sub-category is peculiar to Jainism, and not found in the metaphysics of Buddhism and various schools of Hinduism.     Sikhism   For Sikhs, the word dharam (Punjabi: \u0a27\u0a30\u0a2e, romanized: dharam) means the path of righteousness and proper religious practice.",

According to Pandurang Vaman Kane, author of the book History of Dharma\u015b\u0101stra, the word dharma appears at least fifty-six times in the hymns of the Rigveda, as an adjective or noun. According to Paul Horsch, the word dharma has its origin in Vedic Hinduism. The hymns of the Rigveda claim Brahman created the universe from chaos, they hold (dhar-) the earth and sun and stars apart, they support (dhar-) the sky away and distinct from earth, and they stabilise (dhar-) the quaking mountains and plains.   The Deities, mainly Indra, then deliver and hold order from disorder, harmony from chaos, stability from instability \u2013 actions recited in the Veda with the root of word dharma.

AllMusic said that \"Martin's powerful voice added new fire\" to the band, and the album contained \"some of Iommi's heaviest riffs in years.\" Blender gave the album two stars, claiming the album was \"Black Sabbath in name only\".

Their eponymous debut album Black Sabbath was released on Friday the 13th, February 1970, and reached number eight in the UK Albums Chart. Following its U.S. and Canadian release in May 1970 by Warner Bros. Records, the album reached number 23 on the Billboard 200, where it remained for over a year. The album was given negative reviews by many critics. Lester Bangs dismissed it in a Rolling Stone review as \"discordant jams with bass and guitar reeling like velocitised speedfreaks all over each other's musical perimeters, yet never quite finding synch\".",

The album followed in the UK in October 1970, where, pushed by the success of the \"Paranoid\" single, it reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. The U.S. release was held off until January 1971, as the Black Sabbath album was still on the chart at the time of Paranoid's UK release. The album reached No. 12 in the U.S. in March 1971, and would go on to sell four million copies in the U.S. with virtually no radio airplay. Like Black Sabbath, the album was panned by rock critics of the era, but modern-day reviewers such as AllMusic's Steve Huey cite Paranoid as \"one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time\", which \"defined the sound and style of heavy metal more than any other record in rock history\".",
