In order to capitalize on the growing popularity of comic books\u2014especially those starring superheroes\u2014Goodman created Timely Comics. Timely\u2019s first comic book was Marvel Comics no. 1 (cover dated October 1939), which featured several superhero characters, most notably the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner. Timely Comics introduced many superhero characters during comics\u2019 \u201cGolden Age\u201d in the 1940s, most importantly Captain America, who first appeared in Captain America Comics no. 1 (March 1941). Timely characters were often portrayed as fighting against the Nazis and the Japanese even before the United States entered World War II. As the 1940s came to a close, superheroes fell out of vogue with comic book readers, and Timely canceled the last of its books in this genre in 1950. In 1951, Goodman formed his own distribution company, and Timely Comics became Atlas Magazines. Though there was a brief experiment in bringing back superheroes such as Captain America in 1953, Atlas\u2019s output was mostly in other genres such as humour, westerns, horror, war, and science fiction.",

Familiar to Broadway, radio and early television audiences, this \"Apostle of Pep\" was regarded almost as a family member by millions because his top-rated radio shows revealed intimate stories and amusing anecdotes about his wife Ida and five daughters. His eye-rolling song-and-dance routines eventually led to his nickname, Banjo Eyes, and in 1933, the artist Frederick J. Garner caricatured Cantor with large round and white eyes resembling the drum-like pot of a banjo. Cantor's eyes became his trademark, often exaggerated in illustrations, and leading to his appearance on Broadway in the musical Banjo Eyes (1941). He was the original singer of 1929 hit song \"Makin' Whoopie\".",

This historic paper was a comparative study, which tries to find out what causes a disease by looking at a group of people who have the disease and figuring out how they are different from another group that does not have the disease. Lane-Clayton's study looked at 1000 people who all had the same background and lifestyle (or way of living): 500 people with breast cancer and 500 control patients (people without breast cancer).

The settlement soon grew into a town which was granted market rights by King Otto III in 983.  Originally the market was held on a street called Old Market (Alter Markt), which still exists today.  The first market place was laid out around Saint Andrew's Church. As the city grew larger, a larger market place became more important.  The current market place in Hildesheim was made at the start of the 13th century when the city had a population of about 5,000.  When Hildesheim obtained city rights in 1249, it was one of the largest cities in Northern Germany.  For four centuries the clergy ruled Hildesheim, before a city hall was built and the citizens gained some influence and independence.  Construction of the present City Hall started in 1268, and in 1367 Hildesheim became a member of the Hanseatic League. A war between the citizens and their bishop cost dearly in 1519-1523 when they engaged in a feud. Hildesheim became Protestant in 1542, and only the cathedral and a few other buildings remained in Imperial (Roman Catholic) hands. Several villages around the city remained Roman Catholic as well.
